            This object describes various phases within request-response round trip. 
            All times are specified in milliseconds.
            
            The send, wait and receive timings are not optional and must have non-negative values.
            
            An exporting tool can omit the blocked, dns, connect and ssl, timings on every 
            request if it is unable to provide them. Tools that can provide these timings 
            can set their values to -1 if they don’t apply. For example, connect would be -1 
            for requests which re-use an existing connection.
            
            The time value for the request must be equal to the sum of the timings supplied 
            in this section (excluding any -1 values).
            
            Following must be true in case there are no -1 values (entry is an object in log.entries) :
            entry.time == entry.timings.blocked + entry.timings.dns +
                entry.timings.connect + entry.timings.send + entry.timings.wait +
